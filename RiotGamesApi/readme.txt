#	as i mentioned before(in website), this is the last huge
# reference changes, there is no any huge changes like this
#		i am sorry for the re-configuration
# this changes are important for new game's api for RiotGames, so 
# there will be new game in RiotGames (because it's a company there will be :] ),
# we can add their apis in this package easily, of course some conflicts may occurs
# such as RateLimiting, ApiRequest, ApiOptions, Enum-Types but i have added interfaces for the guide
# i know lack of comments in here but it is not easy to understand the methodology
# feel free to add any comment/summary in codes, if you have any question, you can ask.
